# Just ToDo

"To do app" is one of the most popular types of first applications - an easy concept and a nice opportunity to just try out some important skills. Just ToDo is a web CRUD application fully written in Spring with REST API Support.

## Tech stack

* Spring (r/woosh)
* Spring Security - user authentication
* H2 Database - temporary and quick database for developing purposes.
* Bootstrap - the whole frontend of the app is based on this framework, I need a quick and easy-to-change library with ready-to-go elements.
* Thymeleaf - communication between Backend and Frontend, displaying dynamic information.

## What did I learn?

Developing an application from beginning to end is a long and tough process, my ideas and plans for features were changing during creating the app, which I think gives me some real coding experience. Working on the project gave me the energy to create more advanced websites.

Main user panel, where it's possible to see active tasks (up to 12), change and edit them, add new task or go to the task archive.

After tapping on "Add new task" menu option you will get bootstrap badge with form to fill.

I decided to display the archive of tasks inside the bootstrap table, because I want to make it as readable as I can. It gave me a chance to practice displaying content with thymeleaf.
